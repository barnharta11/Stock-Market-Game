# Capstone Starter Project

## Database

Inside the `API/database/` directory, there's a SQL script called `capstone.sql` that can be used to build and rebuild a Microsoft SQL Server database for the capstone project.

> The SQL script drops the database if it exists and creates a new database called `final_capstone`. You may choose to modify the script to change the database name, or add more tables and data to it.

> If you change the database name, be sure to update the connection string in the server project. See the connection string section for more about this.

### Default users

The script creates two default users for your applicationâ€”you may choose to use them or not. You may also choose to modify the default users and roles as you see fit.

| Username | Password   | Role    |
| -------- | ---------- | ------- |
| `user`   | `password` | `user`  |
| `admin`  | `password` | `admin` |

## ASP.NET Server

An ASP.NET Core Web API server project has been created for you to use as a starting point.

### Connection string

A connection string to the database has been configured for you in `appsettings.json`. It connects to the `final_capstone` database using your Windows login (`Trusted_Connection`).

> You can change the name of this database if you want, but remember to change it here and in the `capstone.sql` script in the database folder:

```json
"ConnectionStrings": {
    "Project": "Server=.\\SQLEXPRESS;Database=final_capstone;Trusted_Connection=True;"
},
```

### CORS

The ASP.NET server has been pre-configured for you to accept Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) requests. This is necessary because your client and server both run on `localhost` but with different ports.

#### Firefox: "CORS request did not succeed"

If you use Firefox for your testing, you may encounter this message in the browser console when attempting a login or any other request from Vue to your .NET server:

```
Cross-Origin Request Blocked: The Same Origin Policy disallows reading the remote resource at https://localhost:44315/login. (Reason: CORS request did not succeed).
```

This is because the HTTPS certificate used by your .NET project is a self-signed certificate intended for development, and [Firefox doesn't consider it valid for CORS requests](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS/Errors/CORSDidNotSucceed). You'll have to tell Firefox to trust your certificate by completing these steps:

1. Open your project URL in Firefox. This should be `https://localhost:44315/`. (Adjust port number if necessary.)
2. Firefox displays a warning message similar to the one below. Click the "Advanced" button:

![Firefox Warning](./img/firefox-security-warning.png)

3. In the "Advanced" panel that opens, click "Accept the Risk and Continue":

Your CORS requests from Vue to your .NET server now work.

### Security

Most of the functionality related to JWT generation and security is located in the `Security` folder. You shouldn't have to modify anything here, but feel free to go through the code if you'd like to see how things work.

### Login Controller

There's a single controller in the `Controllers` folder: `LoginController.cs`. This controller responds to the `/login` and `/register` endpoints and works with the Vue starter as is. If you need to modify the user registration form, start here.

The controller uses the `UserSqlDAO` to read and write data from the `users` table.
